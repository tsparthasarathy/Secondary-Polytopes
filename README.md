# Secondary-Polytopes
Secondary Polytopes are the polytopes whose faces encode information about polytopal subdivisions of an affine configuration of points. Finding secondary polytopes is often computationally demanding as one has to compute all possible triangluations of a given set of affine points. Sage has an implementation of secondary polytopes. However, we are more interested in the information about subdivisions of the affine configuration in combinatorial research. In the program SecSubdiv.sagenews I have designed a way to compute all the maximal subdivisions of the point configuration. The program uses the facet information of the Sage implementation of secondary polytope to compute the former. 
A bonus of the code written above is that on any polytope, given a function on the vertices it can compute the precise subdivision associated to it. Thus a part of the code is independent of the secondary polytope computation of Sage. The secondary polytope, in this way can be viewed as a mere set of vectors which encode what functions to use to get a given subdivision.
